# Documentation for `blocking_rules_library`

The `blocking_rules_library` contains a series of pre-made blocking rules available for use in the construction of blocking rule strategies and em training blocks [as described in this topic guide](./topic_guides/drivers_of_performance.html#blocking-rules).

These conform to a more performant standard that is outlined in detail [here](./topic_guides/drivers_of_performance.html#blocking-rules).


The detailed API for each of these are outlined below.
